    <#
        .SYNOPSIS
            The real IConsoleHost: loads the console XAML with XamlReader and
            shows the window.

        .DESCRIPTION
            THIS IS AN ADAPTER OVER AN EXTERNAL TOOL AND IS DELIBERATELY
            BRANCH-FREE. CLAUDE.md rule 1's only exception to TDD is a thin
            adapter over something that cannot be faked - here WPF itself - and
            the price of that exception is that there is nothing in it worth
            testing. It formats nothing, counts nothing, and decides nothing:
            every string it puts on the screen was decided by
            Get-HDTConsoleTreeNode and every one of them is asserted in
            tests/unit/ConsoleTreeNode.Tests.ps1.

            IT IS THE SAME SHAPE AS New-HDTWizardHost, on purpose. The console
            runs on a desktop with pwsh 7 and the full framework available, so
            none of XamlReader's constraints apply to it - but a page written the
            way the wizard writes them can move into WinPE later without being
            rewritten, and that is the whole reason C1 keeps the pattern.

            XamlReader::Load PARSES MARKUP ONLY. The window carries no x:Class
            and no code-behind; handlers are attached here, by name, after the
            tree exists. The seven names the markup promises are asserted by
            tests/unit/ConsoleWindow.Tests.ps1 against the shipped file.

            THE DEFAULT ANSWER IS EMPTY, NOT 'Close'. A window shut with the X
            never runs the handler, so this returns what it was given - nothing -
            and Show-HDTConsole is what turns that into a Close. The adapter does
            not get to make that decision, because then two places would have an
            opinion about what a dismissed window means.

        .INPUTS
            None. This command does not accept pipeline input.

        .OUTPUTS
            A PSCustomObject with a Show(xaml, title, node, theme) method
            returning 'Close' or an empty string.

        .EXAMPLE
            Show-HDTConsole -Path 'C:\HDTLab\Share' -ConsoleHost (New-HDTConsoleHost)
